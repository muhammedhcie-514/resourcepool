Create an erasure-coded pool object_test and set the number of data chunks to 4 and the
number of coding chunks to 2.
Step 1 Create the erasure coding rule for the pool.
Create an erasure coding rule test and set the number of data chunks to 4 and the
number of coding chunks to 2. To avoid errors, you are advised to set the failure domain
to osd in this lab environment. The specific command is as follows:
[ceph: root@ceph01 /]# ceph osd erasure-code-profile set test k=4 m=2 crush-failure-domain=osd
wallah u a3lam ama bo nardniaty w agar btwawe bigeritawa
cecph osd erasure-codeprofile get test


Step 2 Create the erasure-coded pool.
Create the pool using the created erasure coding rule.
[ceph: root@ceph01 /]# ceph osd pool create object_test erasure test

Step 3 Set the resource pool type.
Set the type of the created resource pool to rgw.
[ceph: root@ceph01 /]# ceph osd pool application enable object_test rgw
